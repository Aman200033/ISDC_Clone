                    <h2><u>About the Department</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        The Department of Commerce from a modest beginning in 1980, has grown to excel in the field of imparting quality education in the city. It aims at equipping its students with knowledge and confidence to face the challenges of the competitive world and carve a niche for themselves in the society. The faculty is well qualified and highly accomplished with a strong academic background. They are driven by a passion to share knowledge and inspire the students to scale new heights.
                        In our endeavor to achieve this, various academics and co-curricular activates are being carried out at under graduate and post graduate level. We also make our students excel in the field of Computer awareness (B.Com. Part-I), English proficiency (B.Com. Part-II) and General Awareness (B.Com. Part-III). Certificate courses for UG students- Entrepreneurship and Business (B.Com. Part-I), E-banking and Finance (B.Com. Part-II), Security Analysis and Investment Management ((B.Com. Part-III) and E-Commerce (6 Months Course) which are run to keep our students abreast with the changed economic scenario.
