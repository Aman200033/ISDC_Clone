                            Iswar Saran Degree College, Allahabad is one of the leading colleges of University of Allahabad, Allahabad imparting higher education in Arts, commerce and science. We have highly qualified, dedicated and committed faculty who are well known in their respective fields of specialization. They are ever ready to provide guidance, sharpen skills and shape up all round personality of the students. Institutions are mainly built on principles and beliefs. Institution builders must respect statues, ordinances, processes and systems. But the mere mechanics of established procedure cannot build beyond that which is already erected. Currently our university system is structured to produce mere consumers of knowledge. The challenge is to create producers of knowledge to enhance our country’s knowledge capita. Higher education in India today therefore demands outstanding academic leadership; we need at the helm individuals who can steer change through belief and conviction, and most importantly empathy – for all stakeholders. Our goal should be to create producers of knowledge though our university system. Students today need to be continually exposed to the changing and ever expanding frontiers of knowledge.
